        <h1 id='bio-hi'>Hi!</h1>
        <p id='bio'> I'm Leor, a second-year Math & Computer Science student at the <strong>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</strong>.</p>
        <p id='interests'>I'm interested in <strong>software engineering, mathematics, and the intersection
        between human-computer interaction and machine learning.</strong></p>
        <p id='current-work'>Currently, I'm a research assistant at the <a href="https://grouplens.org/" target="_blank">GroupLens lab</a>, advised by <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/cs/stevie-chancellor" target="_blank">Stevie Chancellor</a>.
        There, I'm helping build a full-stack application and chatbot that helps facilitate virtual meetings. I was also a teaching assistant for <a href="https://umtc.catalog.prod.coursedog.com/courses/8103461" target="_blank">CSCI 1933</a>, my old university's
        Introduction to Algorithms & Data Structures Course, and have taught <a href="https://umtc.catalog.prod.coursedog.com/courses/8096661" target="_blank">CSCI 1133</a>, the Introduction
        to Computing course.</p>
        <p>I'm on the lookout for opportunities in software engineering for Summer 2024. If you'd like
          to talk, please reach out at porat2@illinois.edu!
